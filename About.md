This Java implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Swing. Designed as a college project, this game allows two players to compete against each other on the same computer, with each player taking turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.

Features

- Graphical User Interface: Built using Java Swing, the game offers a clean and interactive GUI.
- Player Turns: Players can play alternately, and the game will indicate whose turn it is.
- Win Detection: The game detects when a player has won based on the standard Tic-Tac-Toe win conditions.
- Draw Detection: If the board fills up without a winner, the game recognizes a draw.
- Game Reset: Players can start a new game with the reset button.
- Responsive Design: The game interface is designed to be responsive to window size changes.
